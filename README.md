Welcome to the FHB! It's the only platform where you can trade any data format such as videos, images, and datasets. Leverage your data and share it with others through the FIL token, utilizing Lighthouse storage and a token gating system with custom smart contract access control. We make onboarding seamless through Privy, integrating users into the Filecoin storage ecosystem.

## Uploading Data ðŸ“¤

The process of uploading data involves two steps, considering the Filecoin network's slower speeds compared to Layer 2 solutions:

1. **Smart Contract Creation**: Initiate the smart contract creation transaction to secure your data.
2. **Data Insertion**: Insert your data into the universal tableland database.
```
-> To decrypt the data need to purchase (interaction with smart contract),using decryption through lighthouseStorage token gating access control
